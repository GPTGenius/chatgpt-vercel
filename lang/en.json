Please input directly the desired image effect, for example: `a cat`.\n- For model `DALL-E`, expend `OpenAI` tokens. The effective access time for the image link is `2` hours. Please make sure to save it in time if necessary.\n- For model `Midjourney`, depending on the `Discord` configurations, image generation may take a while, with a default timeout of `5` minutes. Please be patient and wait.\n- For model `Replicate`, there are certain free allowances, but they are only available for local and custom deployments. It is recommended to add the prefix `mdjrny-v4 style`",
